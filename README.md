MP3 Streams is a popular audio addon for Kodi.  We want to note that the add-on is not supported by the Kodi team.  Please refrain from asking about MP3 Streams in the Kodi forum.  They will frown on anyone who mentions it on the site.  That being said, the Kodi team does not limit the add-ons users can run so you have full access to install MP3 Streams.
